### My step by step thought process

* I went to this website [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) and did my best to use less divs 
* I cleaned up the navagation taking out the ul and il completley 
* I went to css and saw that the links had there own section with the same code inside so i put them together
* Next I repeated that same process with everything that was split up but the exact same in the end on both html and css
*only one i couldnt do was the class="article" part of the code for some reason each time i took out the class="article" for each **_article section_** the last two would stop getting the css code and i tried many things and couldnt figure out why it didnt work
